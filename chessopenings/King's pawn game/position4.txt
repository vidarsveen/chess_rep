This is the Italian Game: Classical Variation. After 5. d3, the move 6. O-O is superior because it secures the king's safety and prepares for future central pawn breaks. In contrast, 6. Bf4 is less effective, as it doesn't contribute to king safety or central control, leading to a significant evaluation drop.
