This is the Italian Game: Giuoco Pianissimo. After 5. d4, the move is superior because it immediately strikes at the center, opening lines and increasing activity for White's pieces. In contrast, 5. Ng5 is overly aggressive and premature, allowing Black to easily defend and counterattack, resulting in a significant evaluation drop.
