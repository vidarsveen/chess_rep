This is the Italian Game: Giuoco Piano Variation. After 4...Bc5, the move 5. Nd5 is superior because it immediately puts pressure on the f6 queen and the c7 pawn, creating tactical opportunities and forcing Black to respond carefully. In contrast, 5. d3 is more passive, allowing Black to maintain control and develop smoothly, which results in a significant evaluation drop.
