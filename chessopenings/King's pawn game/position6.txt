This is the Italian Game: Giuoco Pianissimo. After 4...Bg7, the move 5. a4 is superior because it prevents Black's potential ...b5 pawn break, securing space on the queenside and preparing for future expansion. In contrast, 5. Be3 is less effective here, as it prematurely develops the bishop to a square where it might be vulnerable to future pawn advances, resulting in a significant evaluation drop.
