This is the Ruy LÃ³pez: Berlin Defense. After 6. d4, the move is superior because it immediately challenges Black's central pawn structure and opens lines for White's pieces, maintaining pressure and activity. In contrast, 6. d3 is more passive, allowing Black to consolidate their position and leading to a significant evaluation drop.
