This is the Sicilian Defense: Alapin Variation. After 3. Qf3, the move Nc6 is superior because it develops the knight to a natural square, supports the control of the d4 square, and prepares for further central action. In contrast, 3...e5 is less effective as it prematurely commits the pawn structure and can lead to weaknesses, resulting in a slight evaluation drop.
