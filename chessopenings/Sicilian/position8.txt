This is the Sicilian Defense: Open Variation. After 4. Nxd4, the move 4...h6 is superior because it prevents the immediate development of White's pieces, particularly the bishop to g5, which can pin the knight and create pressure. In contrast, 4...g6 is less effective at this stage, as it does not address the immediate threat and allows White to develop more freely, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
