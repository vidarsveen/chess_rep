This is the Sicilian Defense: Bowdler Attack. After 4. c3, the move Nf6 is superior because it develops a piece and applies pressure on White's e4 pawn, encouraging White to commit to a pawn structure. In contrast, 4...a6 is a slow pawn move that does not contribute to development or pressure, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
