This is the Sicilian Defense: Alapin Variation. After 2. c3, the move d5 is superior because it directly challenges White's center, aiming to open lines and develop pieces actively. In contrast, 2...g6 is more passive, allowing White to strengthen their central control and leading to a slight evaluation drop.
