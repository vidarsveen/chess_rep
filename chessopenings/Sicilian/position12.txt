This is the Sicilian Defense: Closed Variation. After 6. Ng5, the move e6 is superior because it directly addresses the threat to f7, preparing to solidify the center and develop smoothly. In contrast, 6...Ne5 is less effective as it doesn't address the immediate threat, allowing White to maintain pressure and leading to a more significant evaluation drop.
