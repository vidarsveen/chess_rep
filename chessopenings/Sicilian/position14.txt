This is the Sicilian Defense: Accelerated Dragon Variation. After 7. Bd2, the move Rb8 is superior because it applies pressure on the b2 pawn, preparing for potential counterplay on the queenside. In contrast, 7...Nf6 is less effective at this stage, as it does not immediately challenge White's setup, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
