This is the Sicilian Defense: Alapin Variation. After 2. c3, the move d5 is superior because it directly challenges White's center and opens lines for Black's pieces, maintaining dynamic play. In contrast, 2...g6 is more passive, allowing White to build a strong pawn center with d4, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
