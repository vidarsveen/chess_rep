This is the Sicilian Defense: Alapin Variation. After 2. c3, the move e5 is superior because it directly contests the central squares, particularly d4, and prepares to develop the knight to c6 with a strong pawn presence. In contrast, 2...g6 is less effective as it doesn't immediately challenge White's center, allowing White to build a strong pawn structure and leading to a slight evaluation drop.
