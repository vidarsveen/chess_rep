This is the Sicilian Defense: Nimzowitsch Variation. After 3. Bb5, the move Nf6 is superior because it develops a knight to a natural square, preparing for kingside castling and putting pressure on the e4 pawn. In contrast, 3...Qb6 is less effective as it prematurely moves the queen, potentially exposing it to attacks and not contributing to the development of other pieces, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
