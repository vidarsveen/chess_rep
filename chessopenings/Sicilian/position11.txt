This is the Sicilian Defense: Grand Prix Attack. After 4. Bb5, the move g6 is superior because it prepares to fianchetto the bishop, increasing control over the center and adding pressure on White's pawn structure. In contrast, 4...Qb6 is less effective, as it prematurely develops the queen, which can be easily targeted and doesn't contribute to central control, resulting in a significant evaluation drop.
