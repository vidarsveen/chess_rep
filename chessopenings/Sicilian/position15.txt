This is the English Opening: Anglo-Sicilian Defense. After 2. c4, the move d6 is superior because it directly supports the center and prepares for potential pawn breaks or piece development. In contrast, 2...g6 is less effective as it delays central control, allowing White to advance unchallenged, resulting in a slight evaluation drop.
