This is the Queen's Gambit Declined: Ragozin Defense. After 5. Bd2, the move a5 is superior because it supports the b4-square, preparing to expand on the queenside and maintaining tension. In contrast, 5...Bxd2+ prematurely releases the tension and simplifies the position, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
