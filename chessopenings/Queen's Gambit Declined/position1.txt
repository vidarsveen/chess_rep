This is the Queen's Gambit Declined: Ragozin Defense. After 5. Bd2, the move a5 is superior because it maintains tension and prepares to expand on the queenside, potentially supporting a later b5 pawn break. In contrast, 5...Bxd2+ prematurely releases the tension, allowing White to develop smoothly and slightly weakening Black's position, resulting in a minor evaluation drop.
