This is the Italian Game: Giuoco Pianissimo. After 6. O-O, the move Bxe6 is not ideal because it prematurely exchanges a key bishop without gaining a strategic advantage. By contrast, maintaining the tension with a developing move or a pawn push would be more beneficial, as it keeps options open and maintains pressure on Black's position. The immediate exchange leads to a slight evaluation drop.
