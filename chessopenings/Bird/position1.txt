This is the Bird's Opening. After 2. d4, the move 2...c5 is superior because it directly challenges White's center and opens lines for Black's pieces, creating immediate tension. In contrast, 2...Nc6 is less effective as it does not directly contest White's central presence, allowing White to maintain control and leading to a slight evaluation drop.
