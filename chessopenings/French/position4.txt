This is the French Defense: Wayward Queen Attack. After 2...Qh4, the move 3. Qe2 is superior because it immediately attacks the queen, forcing it to retreat and disrupting Black's premature aggression. By contrast, 3. Nf3 does not address the queen's threat directly, allowing Black to maintain pressure and leading to a significant evaluation drop.
