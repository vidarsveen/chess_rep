This is the Philidor Defense. After 2...d6, the move Bc4 is not optimal because it doesn't put immediate pressure on Black's position and allows Black to continue developing comfortably. Instead, the move d4 would have been more effective, directly challenging the center and opening lines for White's pieces. By playing Bc4, White misses an opportunity to seize the initiative, resulting in a slight evaluation drop.
