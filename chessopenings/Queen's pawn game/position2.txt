This is the Queen's Pawn Game: London System. After 5. Bg3, the move Ne4 is superior because it immediately challenges White's bishop on g3, potentially disrupting White's pawn structure and gaining a tempo. In contrast, 5...Qe7 is a more passive move that doesn't address the immediate tactical opportunities and allows White to continue developing unchallenged, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
