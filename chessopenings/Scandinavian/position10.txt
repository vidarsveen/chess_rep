This is the Scandinavian Defense: Modern Variation. After 7. Bb5, the move Bb5 is superior because it pins the knight on c6, putting pressure on Black's position and preparing for potential exchanges that can open up lines for White's pieces. By contrast, 7. Bf4 is less effective in this position, as it doesn't exert the same level of pressure on Black's setup, leading to a significant evaluation drop.
