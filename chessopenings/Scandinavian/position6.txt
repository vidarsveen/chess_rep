This is the Scandinavian Defense. After 3. Nc3 Qd8, the move 4. Nf3 is standard, developing the knight and preparing to control the center. However, the alternative move 4. Nf3 doesn't change the position, as it's the same move listed twice. In this context, it's important to focus on consistent development and maintaining central control.
