This is the Scandinavian Defense. After 4...Nc6, the main line typically continues with 5. d5, which gains space and challenges Black's knight, putting pressure on Black's position. By contrast, 5. Nf3 is less aggressive and allows Black to develop comfortably, leading to a significant evaluation drop.
