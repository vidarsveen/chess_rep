This is the Scandinavian Defense. After 3. Nc3 Qd8, the move 4. Bb5+ is superior because it immediately puts pressure on Black's position, forcing them to react and potentially disrupting their development. In contrast, 4. Nf3 is less aggressive, allowing Black to develop comfortably and leading to a slight evaluation drop.
