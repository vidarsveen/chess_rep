This is the Scandinavian Defense. After 6...Bb7, the move Be3 is superior because it develops a piece to a central square and prepares for future central control. By contrast, 7. Bg5 is less effective as it pins the knight prematurely and doesn't contribute to immediate central influence, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
