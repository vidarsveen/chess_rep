This is the Scandinavian Defense: Modern Variation. After 5. Nb5, the move is superior because it immediately attacks the queen, forcing it to move again and disrupting Black's development. In contrast, 5. f3 is more passive, as it weakens the kingside pawn structure and allows Black to continue developing comfortably, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
