This is the Scandinavian Defense: Icelandic Gambit. After 2. exd5 c6, the move Nf3 is superior because it develops a piece while preparing to regain the pawn on d5, maintaining pressure and flexibility in the center. By contrast, 3. Nc3 is less effective as it blocks the c-pawn, hindering potential pawn breaks and development, leading to a significant evaluation drop.
