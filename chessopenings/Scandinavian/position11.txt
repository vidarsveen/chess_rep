This is the Scandinavian Defense. After 3...Qd8, the move 4. Bb5+ is superior because it immediately puts pressure on Black, forcing them to react and potentially disrupt their development. In contrast, 4. Nf3 is less effective as it allows Black to continue developing comfortably without immediate pressure, leading to a slight evaluation drop.
