This is the Polish Opening: Outflank Variation. After 7. Be2, the move c6 is superior because it prepares to undermine White's pawn structure on the queenside and opens lines for Blackâ€™s pieces. In contrast, 7...O-O is less effective at this stage, as it delays Black's ability to counter White's pawn advance, resulting in a slight evaluation drop.
