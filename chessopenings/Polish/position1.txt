This is the Polish Opening. After 2. Bb2, the move f6 is superior because it supports the central pawn on e5 and prepares for a potential ...d5 push, gaining space and challenging White's setup. In contrast, 2...d6 is more passive, allowing White to develop comfortably and leading to a slight evaluation drop.
