This is the Owen's Defense. After 3. Nc3 d5 4. exd5, capturing with exd5 is superior because it immediately opens up the center and allows Black to recapture and develop pieces actively. In contrast, 4. Bd3 is less effective as it doesn't address the immediate tension in the center, allowing Black to gain a more favorable position and leading to a significant evaluation drop.
