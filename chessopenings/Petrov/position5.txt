This is the Petrov Defense. After 3. Nxe5, capturing the pawn immediately is superior because it directly challenges Black's central pawn and gains a material advantage. In contrast, 3. Bc4 is less effective as it allows Black to maintain the central tension and develop comfortably, resulting in a significant evaluation drop.
