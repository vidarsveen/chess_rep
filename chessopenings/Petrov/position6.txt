This is the Petrov Defense. After 2...Nf6, the move 3. d3 is considered passive because it does not challenge Black's central pawn on e5 or develop White's pieces aggressively. Instead, 3. Nc3 or 3. d4 would better contest the center and facilitate piece activity. The choice of 3. d3 results in a significant evaluation drop, allowing Black to comfortably equalize or even seize the initiative.
