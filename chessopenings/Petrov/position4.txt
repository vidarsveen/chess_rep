This is the Petrov Defense. After 3. d4, the move d4 is superior because it immediately opens up the center, allowing for rapid piece development and control of central squares. In contrast, 3. Bb5 is less effective here as it doesn't address the central tension and allows Black to maintain a solid structure, leading to a significant evaluation drop.
