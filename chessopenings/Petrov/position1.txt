This is the Petrov Defense: Classical Attack. After 5. Nc3, the move Nc3 is the standard continuation, which develops a piece and prepares for further central control. However, in this case, there is no alternative move provided, so it seems there was a misunderstanding. The move Nc3 is indeed the correct and optimal move in this position.
