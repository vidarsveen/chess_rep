This is the Italian Game: Giuoco Pianissimo. After 3...Bc5, the move 4. d3 is considered passive and less effective because it doesn't challenge Black's setup or develop additional pieces. Instead, a more aggressive move like 4. Nc3 or 4. c3 could have been played to prepare for d4, aiming to control the center and increase White's activity. The move 4. d3 results in a significant evaluation drop, as it allows Black to comfortably continue their development.
