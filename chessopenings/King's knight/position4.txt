This is the Italian Game: Anti-Fried Liver Defense. After 5. Nc3, the move Nc3 is superior because it develops a piece, increases central control, and prepares for further development. In contrast, 5. d5 is more restrictive, prematurely closing the center and hindering the development of Black's pieces, leading to a significant evaluation drop.
