This is the Italian Game: Anti-Fried Liver Defense. After 4...g6, the move 5. Bxf7+ is superior because it immediately disrupts Black's king safety and creates tactical opportunities for White. In contrast, 5. d4 is less effective, allowing Black to maintain a more solid position, which results in a significant evaluation drop.
