This is the Italian Game: Fried Liver Attack. After 7. Qf3+, the move is already optimal and forces Black's king to move, disrupting their ability to castle and creating immediate tactical opportunities for White. There is no alternative move to compare against in this scenario, as Qf3+ is the correct continuation.
