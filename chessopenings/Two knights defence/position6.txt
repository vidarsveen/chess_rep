This is the Italian Game: Two Knights Defense. After 3. Bc4 Nf6, the move 4. Ng5 is superior because it immediately targets the f7 pawn, creating tactical threats and putting pressure on Black's position. In contrast, 4. Nc3 is more passive, allowing Black to develop comfortably and leading to a slight evaluation drop.
