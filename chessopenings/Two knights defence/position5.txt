This is the Italian Game: Two Knights Defense. After 4. Ng5, the move is aggressive and directly targets the f7 pawn, putting immediate pressure on Black's position and potentially leading to tactical opportunities. In contrast, 4. Nc3 is more passive, not exerting the same level of pressure and allowing Black to develop comfortably, resulting in a slight evaluation drop.
